# pomo-direct
Pomodoro notes app built in Ionic &amp; Angular frameworks, using Dexie.js to persist tasks/notes in IndexedDB.

The user is able to run a timer for [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) sessions, which creates a new task when completed or stopped.
The user can edit the task to add details of what was accomplished/completed during the session, submit the task to save it to a sortable table, and export the tasks in several different formats.
